                                Hi! My name is Danish Bashar, welcome to my page. I am a student at the University of Washington studying Informatics.
                                I have a broad range of interests ranging from Psychology to Technology, and I love learning about how things work.
                                My studies currently focus on data analysis and programming, but my work history was focused much more on management and customer service.
                                In my spare time, I usually listen to music, play video games, and watch assorted videos on youtube. 
                                I'm not 100% sure what I want to do in the future, but I feel like my broad range of interests would allow me to work comfortably almost anywhere.
                            </p>

                        Despite having my own personal computer since I was 2 years old, I actually did not begin learning programming until my sophomore year at the University of Washington.
                        I had actually been drifting between majors when I took my first course in Java, and I immediately fell in love.
                        Since then, I have taken courses in web programming, android development, and more.
                        I have not yet worked in the industry as an intern or an employee, but that is my next goal.
                        <br>
                        If you wish to see a more detailed breakdown of my technical skills and programming projects, please visit <a href="technical.html">this page</a>.
